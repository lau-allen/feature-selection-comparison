        "\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "\n",
        "In this problem we will work with the diabetes dataset from sklearn. This data set is for a regression problem where 10 features are used to predict the progression of diabetes. The dataset is described in more detail [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset). You task here is to use multiple techniques of feature selection to try to interpret the strength of the features in the dataset. You will need to use the following techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pearson correlation coefficient using r_regression from sklearn (univariate feature selection)\n",
        "- Mutual information using mutual_info_regression from sklearn (univariate feature selection)\n",
        "- Random forest feature importance using RandomForestRegressor from sklearn (multivariate feature selection)\n",
        "- Recursive feature elimination using sklearn.feature.selection.RFE with a Support Vector Regressor SVR (multivariate feature selection)\n",
        "\n",
        "For each method you will need to plot the feature importance as a bar graph. The importance goes by different names in different algorithms. For example, in r_regression it is just the output (r value) and the mutual information in mutual_info_regression. In random variable it is called feature_importance_ and in RFE it is the ranking_. The bar graph will be sorted from most important features to least important features, with the y value being the importance of that feature, and the x value being the rank but labeled with the feature name.\n",
        "You will also need to print out the top 5 features for each method. You will need to use the following code to load the data and split it into training and testing sets. You will need to use the training set for all of the feature selection methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Are there 3 features that are selected in the top 5 by all 4 methods? \n",
        "* If so, what are they? \n",
        "* If not, what are the 3 features that are selected by the most methods? \n",
        "* How would it be possible that univariate methods might select different features than multivariate methods? \n",
        "* How does dependence between features affect the feature selection methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "For good habits, make sure you split your code into training and testing. You may not even use the testing data but when you do any analysis such as feature selection, remember you must not use the testing data. You should also make sure you use the same random seed for all of your feature selection methods so that you can compare the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hints: In sorting features you use \"arg\" sort. This will return the indices of the sorted array. You can use these indices to sort the feature names.\n",
        "\n",
        "This kind of code will be useful for plotting the bar graph:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "r_inds = np.argsort(np.abs(r_importance))[::-1]\n",
        "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
        "rank = np.arange(len(data.feature_names))\n",
        "ax.bar(rank, r_importance[r_inds])\n",
        "ax.set_xticks(rank)\n",
        "ax.set_xticklabels(np.array(data.feature_names)[r_inds])\n",
